# Radiative_cooling
Radiative cooling of an hydrogen-helium gas in collisional equilibrium of ionization.

The goal of this project is to study
the evolution of an astrophysical gas subjected to cooling processes
radiative. We will first proceed to numerically estimate the state of
ionization of a gas composed of a mixture of hydrogen and helium in
function of temperature under the equilibrium assumption of
collisional ionization. Obtained the ionization state of the gas yes
will have to calculate its rate of radiative cooling in operation
temperature (the so-called cooling function). It will be used later
this result to determine the temporal evolution of the
gas temperature caused by the emission of radiation
(we will assume the gas is transparent to the radiation it emits).
