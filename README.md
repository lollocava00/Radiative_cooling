# Radiative_cooling
Radiative cooling of an hydrogen-helium gas in collisional equilibrium of ionization.

The goal of this project is to study
the evolution of an astrophysical gas subjected to radiative cooling processes.

We will first proceed to numerically estimate the state of
ionization of a gas composed of a mixture of hydrogen and helium in
function of temperature under the equilibrium assumption of
collisional ionization.

Once obtained the ionization state of the gas we
will have to calculate its rate of radiative cooling (via the so-called cooling function). 

This result will be used to determine the temporal evolution of the
gas temperature caused by the emission of radiation
(we will assume the gas is transparent to the radiation it emits).

The whole description of the project's code and numerical methods is in italian in the 'description.pdf' file.
